## Overview

This project provides a complete authentication and authorization foundation built with Go, Gin, GORM, and PostgreSQL. It is structured around independent, domain-focused modules that can be extended or replaced without touching the rest of the app.

**Core features:**
- User registration and login
- Access token and refresh token flow
- Logout, profile, and session management endpoints
- Self profile update and password change
- Email verification, forgot password, and reset password
- Google, Facebook, and Apple social login
- Admin user management
- Audit trail for important auth and user actions
- Optional AI-powered audit log investigator (mock or Ollama)
- Permission-based authorization for admin actions
- Basic rate limiting and security headers
- Request-scoped structured logging with request ID propagation
- Database migration and seeding
- Local Docker workflow with Nginx, PostgreSQL, and Redis
- Generic PostgreSQL-based deployment support

## Environment Configuration

Copy one of the example files depending on your workflow:

- Local development: [`.env.example`](.env.example)
- Docker: [`.env.docker.example`](.env.docker.example)

### Common Variables

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/auth_db?sslmode=disable
TRUSTED_PROXIES=127.0.0.1,::1,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12,192.168.0.0/16
JWT_SECRET=replace-with-a-strong-secret
APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=supersecret
SENDGRID_API_KEY=
SENDGRID_EMAIL=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
FACEBOOK_APP_ID=
FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=
APPLE_CLIENT_ID=
AI_ENABLED=false
AI_PROVIDER=mock
AI_MODEL=qwen2.5:3b
AI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
AI_API_KEY=
```

### Notes

- `DATABASE_URL` is the primary database connection setting.
- `TRUSTED_PROXIES` controls which proxy hops are trusted for forwarded client IP handling.
- The app validates critical configuration at startup and exits early when required values are missing.
- `APP_BASE_URL` is used for backend-generated links such as email verification.
- `FRONTEND_URL` is used for password reset links when you have a separate frontend.
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is optional but recommended so Google token validation checks the audience claim.
- `FACEBOOK_APP_ID` and `FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET` are required for Facebook social login.
- `APPLE_CLIENT_ID` is required for Sign in with Apple token validation.
- `AI_ENABLED=false` keeps the app fully usable without AI.
- `AI_PROVIDER` currently supports `mock` and `ollama`.
- `AUTO_RUN_MIGRATIONS` and `AUTO_RUN_SEEDS` are optional flags for startup-time initialization (keep `false` for local and Docker).

## AI Audit Log Investigator

This project includes an optional AI-powered audit log workflow for admin users.

**Capabilities:**
- Filter and inspect audit logs from admin endpoints
- Export matching audit logs as CSV
- Investigate a selected log window with AI
- Save and retrieve generated investigation results

**Investigation output is structured into:**
- `summary` — high-level description of what was detected
- `timeline` — ordered sequence of relevant events
- `suspicious_signals` — patterns or anomalies flagged by the model
- `recommendations` — suggested next steps

**Required admin permissions:**
- `audit.read` — list logs, export logs, read saved investigations
- `audit.investigate` — create a new AI investigation

### Setup

For quick local testing without a real model:

```env
AI_ENABLED=true
AI_PROVIDER=mock
AI_MODEL=mock-model
AI_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30
```

For real local AI with Ollama:

```env
AI_ENABLED=true
AI_PROVIDER=ollama
AI_MODEL=qwen2.5:3b
AI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
AI_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30
```

Make sure Ollama is running and the model is available:

```bash
ollama serve
ollama pull qwen2.5:3b
```

### Typical Admin Flow

1. Query audit logs with `GET /auth/admin/audit-logs`
2. Narrow the result with filters: `resource`, `status`, `actor_user_id`, `search`, `date_from`, `date_to`
3. Send the same filter scope to `POST /auth/admin/audit-logs/investigate`
4. Review the generated summary and recommendations
5. Re-open saved investigation history from `GET /auth/admin/audit-logs/investigations`

### Investigation Request

```json
POST /auth/admin/audit-logs/investigate

{
  "action": "login",
  "resource": "auth",
  "status": "failed",
  "actor_user_id": 1,
  "search": "invalid credentials",
  "date_from": "2026-04-20T00:00:00Z",
  "date_to": "2026-04-21T00:00:00Z",
  "limit": 50
}
```

### Investigation Response

```json
{
  "summary": "Multiple failed login attempts were clustered in a short time window.",
  "timeline": [
    "2026-04-20T08:00:00Z failed login attempt from 10.0.0.10",
    "2026-04-20T08:03:00Z repeated failure from the same IP"
  ],
  "suspicious_signals": [
    "high number of failed auth events from one IP",
    "repeated attempts against the same resource"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "review the source IP",
    "consider temporary blocking or tighter rate limiting"
  ]
}
```

### Notes

- Identical requests from the same admin over the same log snapshot are deduplicated and return the existing saved investigation.
- The server applies a hard cap to the investigation window to avoid overly large prompts.
- Larger windows are compressed into chunk summaries before being sent to the model.
- Creating or reusing an audit investigation is itself written into the audit log trail.

### Common Failures

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `ai investigator is not enabled` | `AI_ENABLED` is still false | Set `AI_ENABLED=true` and restart |
| `ollama is unavailable` | Ollama is not running | Run `ollama serve` |
| `ollama model is not available` | Model not pulled | Run `ollama pull <model>` |
| `ai investigation timed out` | Model too slow | Increase `AI_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` or use a smaller model |

## API Conventions

- Authenticated routes require `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
- Admin routes require an access token that belongs to an admin user
- Refresh tokens are only valid for `POST /auth/refresh`
- Success responses use the envelope: `status`, `message`, optional `data`, optional `meta`
- Error responses use the envelope: `status`, `message`, optional `errors`
- OpenAPI reference: [`docs/openapi.yaml`](docs/openapi.yaml)
- Swagger UI: served at `/docs`

---

## Local Development

### 1. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update the values to match your local PostgreSQL setup.

### 2. Run migrations

```bash
go run ./cmd/migrate
```

### 3. Run seed data

```bash
go run ./cmd/seed
```

### 4. Start the application

```bash
go run ./cmd/api
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`. The app respects the `PORT` environment variable automatically.

> `go run .` still works but `go run ./cmd/api` is the recommended entrypoint.

---

## Docker Workflow

The Docker setup includes an application container, PostgreSQL, Redis, Nginx gateway, and a `db-setup` container for migration and seed.

```bash
# Start full stack
docker-compose --env-file .env.docker up --build

# Or use Makefile shortcuts
make docker-up
make docker-down
make docker-logs
make docker-rebuild
```

The gateway is exposed at `http://localhost`. The Nginx layer is optional — the app can run directly without it.

---

## Database Tasks

```bash
make migrate-up           # run migrations
make migrate-down         # roll back one migration
make migrate-status       # show migration status
make migrate-create NAME=create_example_table
make seed                 # run seed data
make db-setup             # run migrations + seed
```

---

## Testing

```bash
make test
# or
go test ./...
```

### Manual Testing with Postman

Included files:
- Collection: [`go-api-starterkit.postman_collection.json`](postman/go-api-starterkit.postman_collection.json)
- Environment: [`go-api-starterkit.local.postman_environment.json`](postman/go-api-starterkit.local.postman_environment.json)

Recommended flow: Health → Register → Verify Email → Login → Profile → Update Profile → Change Password → Refresh Token → Logout → Admin endpoints → Audit Logs → AI Investigate

---

## Deployment Notes

This starterkit is designed to stay platform-agnostic.

**Recommended production approach:**
- Provide a PostgreSQL-compatible `DATABASE_URL`
- Run migrations before serving traffic
- Run seed data only when you intentionally need initial roles, permissions, or admin users
- Inject secrets through your deployment platform instead of committing real env files

```bash
go build -tags netgo -ldflags '-s -w' -o app .
./app
```

---

## Security Notes

- Never commit real secrets to the repository
- Use secret managers or platform-managed env vars for production deployments
- Rotate any third-party credentials that were ever exposed locally or in git history
- Use separate credentials for local, staging, and production environments
- Sensitive auth endpoints include in-memory rate limiting to reduce brute-force attempts
- The app sets lightweight security headers: `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`
- Request IDs are propagated via the `X-Request-ID` header
- Trusted proxy handling is configurable through `TRUSTED_PROXIES`

---

## Architecture Notes

- App bootstrap lives in [`internal/appsetup/`](internal/appsetup)
- Runtime configuration is centralized in [`internal/config/app.go`](internal/config/app.go)
- Auth service logic is split by use case under [`internal/modules/auth/`](internal/modules/auth)
- Repository constructors take explicit DB dependencies instead of relying on global DB state
- Admin routes use permission checks instead of role-only checks for finer authorization control
- The recommended Go entrypoint lives in [`cmd/api/`](cmd/api)

---

## Troubleshooting

**`invalid token` on `/auth/profile`**

Usually caused by a stale or incorrect token. Run Login again, confirm `access_token` exists in your Postman environment, and retry.

**`relation "users" does not exist`**

Migrations have not run yet. Run `go run ./cmd/migrate` or `make db-setup`.

---

## Roadmap Ideas

- Add database-backed integration tests
- Split readiness and liveness probes
- Add CI validation for migration and deployment smoke checks
- Further reduce infrastructure-specific behavior inside app startup
