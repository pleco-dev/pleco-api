## Overview

Pleco is a production-oriented authentication and authorization API foundation for Go applications. It gives you the core auth system most products need: JWT login, refresh token rotation, per-device sessions, email verification, password recovery, social login, RBAC, admin user management, audit logging, and optional AI-assisted audit investigation.

The codebase is organized around domain-focused modules, so auth, users, roles, permissions, tokens, social login, audit logs, and monitoring can evolve independently. Each module owns its handler, service, repository, and model, making the project easier to extend than a single large auth package.

Pleco is designed for teams who want a practical starting point for a real backend: secure defaults, PostgreSQL migrations, Redis-backed rate limiting, structured logging, Docker Compose for local development, and deployment-friendly configuration.

**Authentication:**
- User registration and login
- Access token and refresh token flow with token rotation
- Per-device session management - list, revoke, and logout individual sessions
- Self profile update and password change
- Email verification, forgot password, and reset password
- Google, Facebook, and Apple social login with server-side token validation

**Authorization and admin:**
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with fine-grained permission checks per route
- Admin user management
- Token invalidation after password resets, password changes, and role changes

**Security and operations:**
- Audit trail for important auth and user actions
- Optional AI-powered audit log investigator (Ollama, OpenAI, Gemini, or mock)
- Per-route rate limiting with a swappable store abstraction
- Hardened security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
- Request-scoped structured logging with request ID propagation
- Database migration and seeding via golang-migrate
- Local Docker workflow with Nginx, PostgreSQL, and Redis
- Generic PostgreSQL-based deployment support

**Session revocation behavior:**
- Access tokens carry a token-version claim and protected routes reject stale tokens after revocation-sensitive events.
- Password changes and password resets revoke all stored refresh tokens for the user.
- Admin role changes revoke the target user's refresh tokens and invalidate previously issued access tokens.
- `POST /auth/logout-all` revokes every session, including the current access token for subsequent requests.

## Environment Configuration

Copy one of the example files depending on your workflow:

- Local development: [`.env.example`](.env.example)
- Docker: [`.env.docker.example`](.env.docker.example)

### Common Variables

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/auth_db?sslmode=disable
TRUSTED_PROXIES=127.0.0.1,::1,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12,192.168.0.0/16
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000
JWT_SECRET=replace-with-a-strong-secret
APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=supersecret
EMAIL_PROVIDER=disabled
EMAIL_API_KEY=
EMAIL_API_BASE_URL=
EMAIL_FROM=
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Go App
EMAIL_REPLY_TO=
EMAIL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=15
EMAIL_SMTP_HOST=
EMAIL_SMTP_PORT=587
EMAIL_SMTP_USERNAME=
EMAIL_SMTP_PASSWORD=
EMAIL_SMTP_MODE=starttls
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=

FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=
APPLE_CLIENT_ID=
AI_ENABLED=false
AI_PROVIDER=mock
AI_MODEL=mock-model
AI_BASE_URL=
AI_API_KEY=
```

### Notes

- `DATABASE_URL` is the primary database connection setting.
- `TRUSTED_PROXIES` controls which proxy hops are trusted for forwarded client IP handling.
- The app validates critical configuration at startup and exits early when required values are missing.
- `APP_BASE_URL` is used for backend-generated links such as email verification.
- `FRONTEND_URL` is used for password reset links when you have a separate frontend.
- `EMAIL_PROVIDER` supports `disabled`, `smtp`, and select API-based email providers.
- `smtp` is the most flexible option and works with any standard SMTP relay.
- `EMAIL_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_API_BASE_URL`, `EMAIL_FROM`, `EMAIL_FROM_NAME`, and `EMAIL_REPLY_TO` are the shared API-provider settings.
- `EMAIL_SMTP_HOST`, `EMAIL_SMTP_PORT`, `EMAIL_SMTP_USERNAME`, `EMAIL_SMTP_PASSWORD`, and `EMAIL_SMTP_MODE` are used when `EMAIL_PROVIDER=smtp`.
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is optional but recommended so Google token validation checks the audience claim.
- `FACEBOOK_APP_ID` and `FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET` are required for Facebook social login.
- `APPLE_CLIENT_ID` is required for Sign in with Apple token validation.
- `AI_ENABLED=false` keeps the app fully usable without AI.
- `AI_PROVIDER` supports `mock`, `ollama`, `openai`, and `gemini`.
- `AI_BASE_URL` is only required when `AI_PROVIDER=ollama`.
- `REDIS_URL` or `REDIS_HOST`/`REDIS_PORT` enables shared Redis-backed rate limiting and response caching. Without Redis, the app falls back to in-memory stores for local single-instance development.
- `AUTO_RUN_MIGRATIONS` and `AUTO_RUN_SEEDS` are optional flags for startup-time initialization. Keep these `false` for local and Docker workflows — run migrations and seeds manually instead.

## AI Audit Log Investigator

This project includes an optional AI-powered audit log workflow for admin users.

**Capabilities:**
- Filter and inspect audit logs from admin endpoints
- Export matching audit logs as CSV
- Investigate a selected log window with AI
- Save and retrieve generated investigation results

**Investigation output is structured into:**
- `summary` — high-level description of what was detected
- `timeline` — ordered sequence of relevant events
- `suspicious_signals` — patterns or anomalies flagged by the model
- `recommendations` — suggested next steps

**Required admin permissions:**
- `audit.read` — list logs, export logs, read saved investigations
- `audit.investigate` — create a new AI investigation

### Setup

For quick local testing without a real model:

```env
AI_ENABLED=true
AI_PROVIDER=mock
AI_MODEL=mock-model
AI_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30
```

For real local AI with Ollama:

```env
AI_ENABLED=true
AI_PROVIDER=ollama
AI_MODEL=qwen2.5:3b
AI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
AI_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30
```

Make sure Ollama is running and the model is pulled:

```bash
ollama serve
ollama pull qwen2.5:3b
```

For OpenAI:

```env
AI_ENABLED=true
AI_PROVIDER=openai
AI_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini
AI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
AI_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30
```

For Gemini:

```env
AI_ENABLED=true
AI_PROVIDER=gemini
AI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
AI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
AI_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30
```

### Typical Admin Flow

1. Query audit logs with `GET /auth/admin/audit-logs`
2. Narrow the result with filters: `resource`, `status`, `actor_user_id`, `search`, `date_from`, `date_to`
3. Send the same filter scope to `POST /auth/admin/audit-logs/investigate`
4. Review the generated summary and recommendations
5. Re-open saved investigation history from `GET /auth/admin/audit-logs/investigations`

### Investigation Request

```json
POST /auth/admin/audit-logs/investigate

{
  "action": "login",
  "resource": "auth",
  "status": "failed",
  "actor_user_id": 1,
  "search": "invalid credentials",
  "date_from": "2026-04-20T00:00:00Z",
  "date_to": "2026-04-21T00:00:00Z",
  "limit": 50
}
```

### Investigation Response

```json
{
  "summary": "Multiple failed login attempts were clustered in a short time window.",
  "timeline": [
    "2026-04-20T08:00:00Z failed login attempt from 10.0.0.10",
    "2026-04-20T08:03:00Z repeated failure from the same IP"
  ],
  "suspicious_signals": [
    "high number of failed auth events from one IP",
    "repeated attempts against the same resource"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "review the source IP",
    "consider temporary blocking or tighter rate limiting"
  ]
}
```

### Notes

- Identical requests from the same admin over the same log snapshot are deduplicated and return the existing saved investigation.
- The server applies a hard cap to the investigation window to avoid overly large prompts.
- Larger windows are compressed into chunk summaries before being sent to the model.
- Creating or reusing an audit investigation is itself recorded in the audit log.

### Common Failures

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `ai investigator is not enabled` | `AI_ENABLED` is still false | Set `AI_ENABLED=true` and restart |
| `ollama is unavailable` | Ollama is not running | Run `ollama serve` |
| `ollama model is not available` | Model not pulled | Run `ollama pull <model>` |
| `openai error: bad api key` | Invalid or missing OpenAI API key | Set `AI_API_KEY` to a valid OpenAI key |
| `gemini error: unsupported model` | Wrong Gemini model name | Use a supported model such as `gemini-2.5-flash` |
| `ai investigation timed out` | Model too slow | Increase `AI_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` or use a smaller model |

## API Conventions

- Authenticated routes require `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
- Admin routes require an access token that belongs to an admin user
- Refresh tokens are only valid for `POST /auth/refresh`
- Access tokens must include the server-issued token-version claim
- After password reset, password change, role change, or `logout-all`, previously issued tokens can start returning `401` immediately
- Success responses use the envelope: `status`, `message`, optional `data`, optional `meta`
- Error responses use the envelope: `status`, `message`, optional `errors`
- OpenAPI reference: [`docs/openapi.yaml`](docs/openapi.yaml)
- Swagger UI: served at `/docs`

## cURL Examples

Set a base URL first:

```bash
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

### Health

```bash
curl -X GET "$BASE_URL/health"
curl -X GET "$BASE_URL/health/live"
curl -X GET "$BASE_URL/health/ready"
```

### Register

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/auth/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Tester",
    "email": "tester@example.com",
    "password": "secret123"
  }'
```

### Login

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Device-ID: web" \
  -d '{
    "email": "tester@example.com",
    "password": "secret123"
  }'
```

Store tokens for use in subsequent requests:

```bash
TOKENS=$(curl -s -X POST "$BASE_URL/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Device-ID: web" \
  -d '{
    "email": "tester@example.com",
    "password": "secret123"
  }')

ACCESS_TOKEN=$(echo $TOKENS | jq -r '.data.access_token')
REFRESH_TOKEN=$(echo $TOKENS | jq -r '.data.refresh_token')
```

### Profile

```bash
curl -X GET "$BASE_URL/auth/profile" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

### Update Profile

```bash
curl -X PATCH "$BASE_URL/auth/profile" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Tester Updated"}'
```

### Change Password

```bash
curl -X PATCH "$BASE_URL/auth/change-password" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "current_password": "secret123",
    "new_password": "newsecret123"
  }'
```

After a successful password change, existing refresh tokens are revoked. Log in again before calling `POST /auth/refresh` or other authenticated flows with an old session.

### Refresh Token

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/auth/refresh" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"refresh_token\": \"$REFRESH_TOKEN\"}"
```

### Verify Email

```bash
curl -X GET "$BASE_URL/auth/verify?token=<verify-token>"
```

### Resend Verification

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/auth/resend-verification" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "tester@example.com"}'
```

### Forgot Password

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/auth/forgot-password" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "tester@example.com"}'
```

### Reset Password

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/auth/reset-password" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "token": "<reset-token>",
    "new_password": "newsecret123"
  }'
```

After a successful password reset, existing refresh tokens are revoked and older access tokens can be rejected immediately on protected routes.

### Social Login

Supported providers: `google`, `facebook`, `apple`.

- Google and Apple expect an ID token.
- Facebook expects a user access token.
- All three use the same `token` field for consistency.
- The starterkit requires an email from the provider to map or create a local user.

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/auth/social-login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Device-ID: web" \
  -d '{
    "provider": "google",
    "token": "<provider-token>"
  }'
```

### Sessions

List active sessions:

```bash
curl -X GET "$BASE_URL/auth/sessions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Device-ID: web"
```

Revoke one session by ID:

```bash
curl -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/auth/sessions/1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

Logout current session:

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/auth/logout" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Device-ID: web"
```

Logout all sessions:

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/auth/logout-all" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

After `logout-all`, the current access token should be treated as expired for the rest of the session and the user should log in again.

Logout every session except the current device:

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE_URL/auth/logout-others" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Device-ID: web"
```

### Admin: Users

```bash
# List users
curl -X GET "$BASE_URL/auth/admin/users?page=1&limit=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"

# Get user by ID
curl -X GET "$BASE_URL/auth/admin/users/1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"

      "role.update_permissions"
    ]
  }'
```

  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"

# Export audit logs as CSV
curl -X GET "$BASE_URL/auth/admin/audit-logs/export?resource=auth&status=failed" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

### Admin: AI Audit Investigation

```

---

## Local Development

### 1. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update the values to match your local PostgreSQL setup.

### 2. Run migrations

```bash
go run ./cmd/migrate
```

### 3. Run seed data

```bash
go run ./cmd/seed
```

### 4. Start the application

```bash
go run ./cmd/api
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`. The app respects the `PORT` environment variable automatically.

---

## Docker Workflow

The Docker setup includes an application container, optional PgBouncer connection pooling, PostgreSQL, Redis, Nginx gateway, and a `db-setup` container that handles migrations and seeding.

```bash
# Start the full stack
docker-compose --env-file .env.docker up --build

# Or use Makefile shortcuts
make docker-up
make docker-down
make docker-logs
make docker-rebuild
```

The gateway is exposed at `http://localhost`. The Nginx layer is optional - the app can run directly without it.

PgBouncer is included in Docker as a production-like pooling layer for scalable deployments. In this stack, API traffic uses PgBouncer at `pgbouncer:5432`, while the `db-setup` container connects directly to Postgres for migrations and seed data. For simple local development or small deployments, Pleco can still connect directly to PostgreSQL with a normal `DATABASE_URL`.

---

## Response Caching

Pleco caches hot auth/admin reads with Redis when `REDIS_URL` or `REDIS_HOST` is configured. If Redis is unavailable, it falls back to an in-memory cache suitable for local single-instance development.

| Endpoint / Path | Cache Key | TTL |
|---|---:|---:|
| `GET /auth/admin/users/:id/permissions` | `user:permissions:{userID}` | 10 minutes |
| `GET /auth/profile` | `user:profile:{userID}` | 5 minutes |
| `GET /auth/admin/roles` | `roles` | 20 minutes |
| `GET /auth/admin/roles/:id` | `role:{roleID}` | 15 minutes |
| `GET /auth/admin/roles/:id/permissions` | `role:{roleID}:permissions` | 15 minutes |
| `GET /auth/admin/users/:id` | `user:detail:{userID}` | 5 minutes |
| `GET /auth/social/:provider/account` | `social:account:{userID}:{provider}` | 15 minutes |

Permission middleware also caches role permission checks for 10 minutes using `role:permission:{role}:{permission}`. User and role writes invalidate the related cached profile, detail, permission, and role entries so authorization-sensitive changes are refreshed promptly.

## Database Tasks

```bash
make migrate-up                              # run all pending migrations
make migrate-down                            # roll back one migration
make migrate-down-all                        # roll back all migrations
make migrate-status                          # show migration status
make migrate-create NAME=create_example_table  # create a new migration file
make migrate-force VERSION=1                 # force migration version
make migrate-drop CONFIRM=1                  # drop the schema (destructive)
make seed                                    # run seed data
make db-setup                               # run migrations + seed
```

## Testing

```bash
make test
# or
go test ./...
```

### Manual Testing with Postman

Included files:
- Collection: [`pleco.postman_collection.json`](postman/pleco.postman_collection.json)
- Environment: [`pleco.local.postman_environment.json`](postman/pleco.local.postman_environment.json)

Recommended flow:

1. `Health`
2. `Register`
3. `Verify Email` — or mark the user as verified directly in the database
4. `Login` — stores `access_token` and `refresh_token` automatically
5. `Profile`
6. `Update Profile`
7. `Change Password`
8. `Refresh Token`
9. `Sessions` — list and revoke individual sessions
10. `Logout`
11. Admin requests with an admin token
12. `Audit Logs` — filter by resource, status, date range
13. `AI Investigate` — run an investigation over a filtered log window

Notes:
- `Login` and `Refresh Token` update the Postman environment variables for `access_token` and `refresh_token` automatically.
- `Logout Other Sessions` also rotates and stores fresh `access_token` and `refresh_token`.
- `Verify Email` and `Reset Password` require manual token input unless you automate email capture.
- Admin endpoints require an admin access token.
- The AI investigate endpoint requires `AI_ENABLED=true` in your environment.

### Automated API Checks with Newman

Install the Newman dependency once:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the local collection against the checked-in environment file:

```bash
npm run postman:local
# or
make postman-test
```

This uses:
- `postman/pleco.smoke.postman_collection.json`
- `postman/pleco.local.postman_environment.json`

The collection expects the API to already be running at the `base_url` configured in the environment file.

For the full manual collection, including flows that need verification/reset tokens or intentionally mutate credentials:

```bash
npm run postman:manual
```

Run the negative test suite for validation/authz/error handling:

```bash
npm run postman:negative
# or
make postman-negative
```

Run both positive smoke checks and negative checks in one command:

```bash
npm run postman:all
# or
make postman-all
```

## Deployment Notes

This starterkit is designed to stay platform-agnostic.

**Recommended production approach:**
- Provide a PostgreSQL-compatible `DATABASE_URL`
- Run migrations before serving traffic
- Run seed data only when you intentionally need initial roles, permissions, or admin users
- Inject secrets through your deployment platform instead of committing real env files
- The app does not redirect HTTP to HTTPS — this should be handled at the gateway or load balancer layer. Do not expose port 8080 directly to the public internet without TLS termination in front of it.

Build and start:

```bash
go build -tags netgo -ldflags '-s -w' -o app ./cmd/api
./app
```

---

## Security Notes

- Never commit real secrets to the repository.
- Use secret managers or platform-managed env vars for production deployments.
- Rotate any third-party credentials that were ever exposed locally or in git history.
- Use separate credentials for local, staging, and production environments.
- The default rate limiter is in-memory and works correctly for a single instance. For multi-instance deployments, replace it with a shared backend such as Redis using the `RateLimitStore` interface.
- The app sets baseline security headers including CSP, HSTS (on HTTPS), `X-Content-Type-Options`, and `X-Frame-Options`.
- Request IDs are propagated via the `X-Request-ID` header for tracing across the gateway and backend.
- Trusted proxy handling is configurable through `TRUSTED_PROXIES` so client IP-based audit and rate limiting work correctly behind a gateway.
- Refresh tokens are rotated on every use — old tokens are invalidated immediately.
- Password reset tokens are invalidated if the user changes their password after the token was issued.

---

## Architecture Notes

- App bootstrap lives in [`internal/appsetup/`](internal/appsetup)
- Runtime configuration is centralized in [`internal/config/app.go`](internal/config/app.go)
- Auth service logic is split by use case under [`internal/modules/auth/`](internal/modules/auth)
- Repository constructors take explicit DB dependencies instead of relying on global DB state
- Admin routes use permission checks instead of role-only checks for finer authorization control
- The recommended Go entrypoint lives in [`cmd/api/`](cmd/api)

---

## Troubleshooting

**`invalid token` on `/auth/profile`**

Usually caused by a stale or incorrect token:
- A `refresh_token` was used instead of an `access_token`
- The access token has expired (15-minute window)
- The token was not stored correctly in Postman

Fix: run Login again, confirm `access_token` is set in your active Postman environment, and retry.

**`relation "users" does not exist`**

Migrations have not run yet. Fix:

```bash
go run ./cmd/migrate
# or
make db-setup
```

**`email not verified` on login**

The user was registered but the verification email was not clicked. Either:
- Check your inbox and click the link
- Resend with `POST /auth/resend-verification` and a JSON email body
- Or set `is_verified = true` directly in the database for development

**`ai investigator is not enabled` on `/auth/admin/audit-logs/investigate`**

`AI_ENABLED` is `false` in your environment. Set `AI_ENABLED=true`, choose a provider, and restart the server. For quick testing, use `AI_PROVIDER=mock`.

**Social login returns `email not available from <provider>`**

The provider did not return an email in the token payload. This can happen when:
- The user has not granted email permission on the provider side
- Apple Sign In is used for the first time and the email is hidden by Apple

Ensure email scope is requested in your frontend OAuth flow before calling this endpoint.

**`relation "audit_investigations" does not exist`**

The migration for the AI investigation feature has not run. Run all pending migrations:

```bash
go run ./cmd/migrate
```

## Roadmap Ideas

- Redis-backed rate limit store for multi-instance deployments
- Readiness and liveness probe endpoints
- Database-backed integration tests
- CI validation for migration smoke checks
- Refresh token family tracking to detect token theft

## Monitoring & Observability

Pleco includes optional monitoring with AI-powered error analysis capabilities.

### Basic Monitoring

Monitor errors with Sentry or Datadog. It automatically captures 5xx errors and supports standard metrics.

```env
# Using Sentry
MONITORING_PROVIDER=sentry
SENTRY_DSN=https://key@sentry.io/project
```

```env
# Using Datadog
MONITORING_PROVIDER=datadog
DATADOG_API_KEY=your_key
```

```bash
go run ./cmd/api
```

### AI-Powered Error Analysis

When enabled, AI analyzes error patterns, stores root causes in the database, and samples errors to save AI provider costs (analyzing 1 in N errors).

```env
MONITORING_PROVIDER=sentry
SENTRY_DSN=...
AI_MONITORING_ENABLED=true
AI_MONITORING_ERROR_THRESHOLD=5
AI_PROVIDER=ollama
AI_MODEL=qwen2.5:3b
AI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
```
